## Preparation

### Directory Structure

Before running a simulation, a directory structure has to be prepared and the appropriate input files have to be placed.
To run a simulation in the folder `system_0000` the following structure must be in place:

* [history.txt](./history.txt)
* [system_0000](./system_0000)
    * [inputs](./inputs)
        * [options.txt](./inputs/options.txt)
        * [disk.txt](./inputs/disk.txt)
    * [outputs](./outputs)

The `history.txt` can be placed anywhere, but the path has to be specified when executing(more detail later). It is used
to keep track of all simulation runs and stores starting, end and runtime. In the `input` directory the `options.txt`
and `disk.txt files have to be saved. More on the structure of these files in the next section. The output directory
should be empty.

### Input Files

#### `options.txt` File

The `options.txt` file is a space seperated list of keys and values. An example file can be found in the repository.
Here we list all options with a short description:

- `MP`: The mass of the central star in Jupiter units.
- `RP`: The radius of the central star in Jupiter units.

#### `disk.txt` File

The disk file needs to consist of 1000 cells. Each cell corresponds to a row in the disk file. The columns have to be
ordered as follows:

- `index`: index of the cells starting from 0.
- `radius`: Midpoint orbital distance of cell in central star radii.
- `dradius`: Annular width of the cell in central star radii.
- `sigmagas`: Gas density value in central star units.
- `sigmadust`: Dust density value in central star units.
- `sigmadustbar`: Backup dust density value in central star units.
- `temperature`: Temperature value in Kelvin.
- `area`: Area of the annulus in central star units.
- `keplerianvelocity` : Keplerian velocity at `radius` in central star radii per year.
- `gasopacity`: Gas opacity of the disk. This should be filled with zeros, since the code calculates the opacities.
- `wmf`: Water mass fraction bodies inherit when initialized at `radius`.
- `swmf`: Solid water mass fraction bodies inherit when initialized at `radius`.
- `headwindfactor`: Headwind factor. Only used for pebble accretion. Fill with zeros in case of no pebble accretion.

The values within a row should be `space` or `tab` separated. Column names must not be included in the input disk file.

## Installation and Compiling

The code was developed in C++ 11 using CMake version 3.20 for ease of debugging and compilation. In the repository you
can find the `CMakeLists.txt`, and we highly recommend using it. Simple compilation can also be done using a normal
Makefile. Once the repository is pulled into the desired folder. While being in the `3DPopSynthesis` directory, it can
be compiled using the following command.

```bash
make build
```

This calls the file `Makefile` and creates a folder `build_outputs`, where all intermediate build files are stored. The
executable `3DPopSynis created in the `3DPopSynthesis` directory. Now the simulation is ready to be started. For the
compilation and usage on the ETH Euler cluster, you first have to load the relevant modules; gcc, python and cmake.
```
module load gcc/6.3.0 python/3.8.5
module load cmake/3.20.3
```

## Running a single Simulation

Once the directories and input files are set up, the compiled program can be run. It takes 3 arguments:

- `in`: The path to the `inputs` directory.
- `out`: The Path to the `outputs` directory.
- `hist`: The path to the `history.txt` file.

To start the simulation run:

```
./3DPopSyn in out hist
```

If you and the example folder `system_0000` are in the same directory as the compiled Program, the command to start the
simulation would look as follows:

```bash
./3DPopSyn system_0000/inputs system_0000/outputs history.txt
```

If the code has been run but crashed or ended before finishing, it can be restarted by entering the same command again.
The code automatically detects the last state and continues from there.

### Output Files

Once the simulation is completed you can see several files and directories in the `output` folder. The three files
keeping track of the satellites and their collisions are: `satellite_list.txt`, `collisions.txt`
and `lost_satellites.txt`. For every snapshot a directory with the files `satellites.txt`, `disk.txt`
and `parameters.txt` is created. Finally, a folder called `restart` is used as backup in the case the simulation
crashes. `restart` looks exactly like a snapshot but without the column names in the files. All output files consist of
rows for each entry. The values per row are `space` or `tab` separated.

## Code Overview

The code is structured into modules which define different parts and handle specific tasks. The file `main.cpp` serves
as an interface to the  `EvolutionModel` class defined in the `EvolutionModule.*` files. It sets up a model, starts it
and counts the runtime. In the `EvolutionModule.cpp` all other modules are combined to calculate all relevant
quantities. A `DiskModule::DiskModel` is set up containing all relevant information for the evolution of the disk. It
includes functions to calculate disk properties and evolve the disk in time. A list of `SatelliteModule::SatelliteModel`
is created in for teh `EvolutionModel`. Again, the `SatelliteModel` contains all relevant parameters an individual
satellite. The dynamical evolution is however handled in with the `NBodyModule`. With pointers pointing on the
coordinates and velocities it changes theses with time. When ever the satellites interact with the disk, the calcuations
are done within the `EvolutionModule`.
